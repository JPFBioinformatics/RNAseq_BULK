WSL/Mamba setup guide for VSCode development

gotta use linux for the HPC cluster we will be running pipeline on

install WSL and Ubuntu 22.04, create a login

User: 	username
PW:		password

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up WSL with VSCode:

Open VScode

ctrl+shift+p
type in WSL Remote: New Window

this will change your file explorer on the left side of the screen

you will see a directory called WSL targets, and in that directory will be a file with a name that is labelled "default distro" 
	default distro will be to the right of the file name in a darker text color

hit the arrow pointing right on this file, this will restart your VSCode window using WSL or the file looking button will open a new window

Now vscode is connected to WSL correctly

MAKE SURE to not open a workspace that is on your normal windows machine, you will have to make one in the windows WSL partition or VSCode will swich back to 
windows mode so it won't work

if you already created your workspace and want to copy it to WSL you can use this command in an ubuntu termninal:
	cp -r /mnt/c/path/to/folder $HOME/new_folder_name

You will know you are in the correct version of VSCode if you see a little blue box in the bottom left of your VSCode window that says WSL: Ubuntu-22.04 or whatever
linux thingy you are using

To open a new WSL terminal just hit the little dropdown menu arrow on the top right of your PS terminal and choose your Linux distro
	it will have a header like this: WSLusername@something:/path/to/workspace/folder$

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up Mamba enviornment:

in WSL terminal in VSCode:

	download latest miniforge3 installer:
		wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

	run installer:
		bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

			hit enter to continue to liscence
			mash enter until it prompts you to say 'yes' or 'no'
			say yes to initialize

	now you should have a Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh file or something like that

	make sure to initialzie your shell for mamba:
		mamba shell init --shell bash --root-prefix=~/.local/share/mamba

		if youi do not initialize mamba correctly then you won't create the rnaseq correctly
		create will work fine but activate will say no env at location if you do not initialize correctly

	now create mamba enviornment named rnaseq:
		mamba create -n rnaseq python=3.10

		we use python for this project so python 3.10 is used

	active enviornment:
		mamba activate rnaseq

	if you're used to using a venv you may expect a folder to show up in your workspace but in conda the env is stored globally
	so it is not going to show up here
	you know it worked if your terminal now has the header (rnaseq) instead of (base)

now that you have your env setup and activated (MAKE SURE you are using (rnaseq) and not (base) and in a WSL/linux terminal)
its time to install the required packages/dependancies for the pipeline:

	mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda fastqc cutadapt trim-galore star samtools subread
